Post-processing toolbox for turbulence DNS simulations.

## About

<!-- start about -->

**ROAST** (ROAST is an OpenSource Analysis Software for Turbulence) is a
Python package providing a post-processing toolbox for turbulence DNS
simulations.
It is dedicated to DNS code POUSSINS used by the
Turbulence and Instabilities team of the [LMFA] laboratory
(Lyon, France)
and provides modules allowing:

- computation of descriptive quantities of incompressible flows
- computation of descriptive quantities of turbulent flows
- statistic post-processing of simulation data
- simulation result visualization

Although it is developed as a post-processing tool
for the POUSSINS code, ROAST computation functions are generic
and can be run on any NumPy array.

## Quick start

<!-- start quickstart -->

0. Install ROAST and its dependencies

   ```shell
   git clone git@github.com/loicreynier/roast
   cd roast
   poetry Install
   ```

1. Load data from a POUSSINS simulation

   ```python
   >>> import roast
   >>> import pathlib
   >>> path = Path("./Data/Simu-1")
   >>> df = roast.parallel.h5file(path / "data.hdf5")
   >>> simu = roast.poussins.Simulation("Re1000", df, path, data=(0, 100, 1))
   ```

<!-- end quickstart -->
